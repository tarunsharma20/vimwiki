= Jumplist =
Vim remembers the locations you have recently visited (where you jumped from).  Each position (file name, column number, line number) is recorded in a jump list, and each window has a separate jump list that records the last 100 positions where a jump occurred.

`%`      : Jump to the matching braces or parenthesis.
`{`      : Jump backward one paragraph.
`}`      : Jump forward one paragraph.
`(`      : Jump backward one sentence.
`)`      : Jump forward one sentence.
`n%`     : Jump to the nth percentage line of the file
`nG`     : Jump to the nth line of the file
`G`      : Jump to the end of the file
`gg`     : Jump to the beginning of the file
`H`      : Jump to the top (high) of the screen
`M`      : Jump to the middle (medium) of the screen
`L`      : Jump to the bottom (low) of the screen
``‚Äù`     : Jump to the position where you were in NORMAL MODE while last closing the file
``^`     : Jump to the position where you were in INSERT MODE while last closing the file
`ctrl-o` : Jump backward in jump list
`ctrl-i` : Jump forward in jump list
`:jumps` : View the content of Jumplist
